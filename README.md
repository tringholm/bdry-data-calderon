This is the code used to perform the numerical tests in the paper "Boundary determination for hybrid imaging from a single measurement" by Tommi Brander and Torbj√∏rn Ringholm.

To reproduce the results, run test.m. By altering the true conductivity in c.m, other conductivities can be tested. A larger or smaller number of samples can be used by varying the M parameter in test.m.
